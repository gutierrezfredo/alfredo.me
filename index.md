<h1> Alfredo Gutierrez </h1>

I'm a [product designer](https://alfredo.design/). Currently designing operational software for the surrogacy industry at [Orchid Software Solutions](https://www.orchidsoftsolutions.com/).

Over the past 7 years, I’ve helped scale startups and companies by developing custom, reliable software that streamlines business processes across healthcare, surrogacy, legal services, and government contracting industries.

Outside of work, I’m passionate about [poetry](https://alfredo.blog/), surfing, music, learning languages, photography, and traveling.

I share my thoughts and tutorials on design, projects, and personal life on my [blog](https://alfredo.design/blog/). You can also see what I’m currently working on in my [professional changelog](https://alfredo.design/logs/).
